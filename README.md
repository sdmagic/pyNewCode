## Description:

This application preforms all the usual start-of-project tasks for a new project. It:

**NOTE:**

All writing is driven by the YAML configuration file -- If you don't want
the file or directory, you can just set that item to false.

- Creates the project's directory structure
  - Creates a project directory (if we're not using the current directory)
    - All directories will be subdirectories off the project directory
  - Creates a configuration directory (for the project's config files)
  - Creates a logs directory (for the project's log files)
  - Creates a modules directory (for the project's modules and utilities)

- Creates a Project's base files
  - Will warn and ask if a file already exists
  - Creates the project's main file (starup point)
  - Creates the project's configuration file
  - Creates the project's modules\\__init__.py file
  - Creates the project's YAML file
  - Creates a todo.txt file for the project
    - Please follow the instructions in this file after generation
